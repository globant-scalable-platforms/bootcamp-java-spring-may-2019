# Collection challenges

This path contains the java files to solve the collections challenges for the first week:

- src/collectionsperformance
ListPerformance.java -> Display the performance for List collections.
MapPerformance.java -> Display the performance for Map collections.

- /src/ransomnote
RansomNote.java -> Solve the HackerRank challenge using map collections. Includes the automatic test cases result from hackerrank.

### Collections performance findings
The tests were executed with 7.500.000 values and it got the next results:

##### Lists
The Arraylist was faster than linkedlist in all tests, except to add an element where the result was immediate. 
e.g.

| Test | Arraylist | Linkedlist
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Insert an element in the middle | 2ms | 95ms |
| Remove an element from the middle | 2ms | 97ms |
| Add an element | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| Iterate | 75ms | 137ms |
| Sort | 6766ms | 7134ms |

##### Map
The Arraylist was faster than linkedlist in all tests with immediate response, except to the iterate where the treemap took about twice the time. 
e.g.

| Test | Hashmap | Treemap
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Put an element | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| Find by key | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| Remove by key | < 1ms | < 1ms |
| Iterate | 441ms | 913ms |
